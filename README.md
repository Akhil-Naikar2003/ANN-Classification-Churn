# üß† Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Predicting whether a customer will leave a bank ‚Äî before they actually do ‚Äî is a powerful tool for improving customer retention and increasing profitability. This project uses a deep learning approach with an ANN to build a predictive model using customer profile data.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Preprocess raw customer data using label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling
- Build a deep learning model with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluate and tune the model
- Save and serialize the model and preprocessing tools for future inference
- Visualize training performance using TensorBoard

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **TensorBoard** (for visualization)
- **Pickle** (for saving model components)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional for EDA)
- **Streamlit** (for UI deployment ‚Äì coming soon!)

## üìà Results

- Training Accuracy: ~87%
- Validation Accuracy: ~86%
- Binary classification (Churn / Not Churn)
